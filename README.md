## ‚ö° Quick Info<a name="quick-info"></a>
Using the NBER mortality data set, we analyzed the relationship between factors such as manner of death, marital status, race, sex, age, timing of death, and more, built models, and discovered interesting patterns.

## ‚ú® Getting Started<a name="getting-started"></a>
To get started, place the mortality.sqlite file from https://rice.app.box.com/s/qpc37cwxycp4ge3wsn7449w4qlojpabm into the ./data folder in the project root directory.

## üîé Data Set<a name="data"></a>
The National Bureau of Economic Research creates and distributes a dataset of US mortality for every year since 1959. This dataset is unique for both its breadth and depth. Each row in the dataset represents a single death, and each column represents a different demographic characteristic of the deceased. The information is derived from death certificates filed by medical professoinals in the 50 states plus Washington DC.
